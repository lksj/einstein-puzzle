The game goal is to open all cards in a 6x6 square of cards.  When
every card is open, the field looks like this:

$opensquare.bmp$

Every row of squares contains cards of one type only.  For example,
the first row contains arabic digits, the second - letters, the third - roman
digits, the fourth - dice, the fifth - geometric figures, and the sixth - 
mathematical symbols.

Use logic, and open cards using the method of exclusion.  If a card
isn't opened, it contains every possible card.  For example,

$closed.bmp$

means that this cell may contain every roman digit except
III (because the III card is absent).  To open a card,
left-click on the small image.  To exclude a card, right-click on
it.

Use the tips to solve the puzzle.  There are two types of tips:
horizontal and vertical.  Vertical tips are located at the bottom
of the screen.  For example, the vertical tip

$verthint.bmp$

means that the letter 'B' and the '+' sign are in the same column.

Horizontal tips are located at the right side of the puzzle square.
There are a few types of horizontal tips.  The first type of horizontal
tip says that two cards are located in neighbouring columns, but it is
unknown which one is on the right side and which is on the left:

$hornearhint.bmp$

The second tip type means that one card is to the left of another.
It says nothing about the distance between the cards.  They may be
in neighbouring columns or at opposite sides of the puzzle field:

$horposhint.bmp$

The last type of tip means that one card is located between
two other cards:

$horbetweenhint.bmp$

All three cards must be located in neighbouring columns, and the central
card is always between the other two, but it is unknown which card is located
on the right side and which is on the left.

If you no longer need a tip, remove it by right-clicking on it.
You can always see removed tips by pressing the 'Switch' button.
